# scores-and-playlists

The files 'Average results [...]' contain the average results per volunteer using the pre-trained network. Theses are the results we obtained with a initial learning rate which performed the best among all users: 0.05 with or without Transfer Learning.

The files 'Cross Validation' contain the different scores for different learning rates, with all cross validation folds for different volunteers.

The archive 'Volunteer_playlists.zip' contains the 4 playlists made by each volunteer. In this experiment, the 'like' and 'love' playlists was merged into 'Like', 'don't like' and 'hate' were merged into 'Dislike'. For each track, The Artist, the name of the song and the Deezer ID are provided.
