# scores-and-playlists

The files 'Average results per volunteer' contain the average results per volunteer using the pre-trained network. Theses are the results we obtained with a initial learning rate which performed the best among all users: 0.05 with or without Transfer Learning.

The files 'Cross Validation' contain the different scores for different learning rates, with all cross validation folds for different volunteers.

The archive 'Volunteer_playlists.zip' contains the 4 playlists made by each volunteer. For each track, The Artist, the name of the song and the Deezer ID are provided.
